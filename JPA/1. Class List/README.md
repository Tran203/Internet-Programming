# ClassList
 This web application uses EJBs( <em> Singleton </em> ) to store info into a database
 
 Let us create a Person entity that maps to a PERSON_TBL table in the database. 
 The entity must have four fields, a primary key field called id; firstName; lastName; and creation date. 
 The firstName field must be mapped to the name column in the table. 
 The field must not be nullable and its maximum length must be 20. 
 The last-Name must not be persisted into the database.
 The creation date must be the timestamp.
